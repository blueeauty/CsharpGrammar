Compilation Process:
1、Transformation:	a particular character and encoding scheme =>	a sequence of Unicode Characters
2、Lexical analysis:	a stream of Unicode input characters =>		a stream of tokens
3、Syntactic analysis:	the stream of tokens =>	executable code

Lexical grammar and Syntactic grammar

Five basic elements make up the lexical structure of a C# compilation unit:
1、Line terminators
2、White space
3、Comment
4、Tokens
5、Pre-processing directives

The Lexical processing of a C# compilation unit consists of reducing the file into a sequence of tokens that becomes the input to the syntactic analysis
Line terminators,white space,and comments can serve to separate tokens,and pre-processing directives can cause sections of the compilation unit to be skipped,
but otherwise these lexical elements have no impact on the syntactic structure of a C# program
